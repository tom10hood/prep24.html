My cause is driven “I love my brothers” this is a phrase I use quite often. This phrase means  I love the men in my life whom I consider family. I have a twin brother, but I have a lot more brothers as well. I have been through a lot during my college career and men in my life have helped me through that. When I utter this phrase on Centre’s campus it is usually directed at my fraternity brothers, or my Brothers in Christ. These two groups are quite different, but the support I have received from them has given me the strength to complete the difficult tasks life put s in from of me. One reason I want to do well is because my peers have invested time and effort into my development, and I cannot let them down.
