          Correlation can be used as a tool to help discover causations. Correlation only applies when the relationship between variables is linear. Correlation implies that the data points between variables are associated. Causation implies that one variable causes the data points of the other variable to change. First we can look at correlations and regressions as clues to imply causation when we control for other factors. A regular scatter plot with a line conveying correlations is a great way to show data. It is the most common kind of way to display data, and show correlations and look to find causations. A more sophisticated version of a scatter plot is a scatter plot matrix. A scatter plot matrix looks like a colored excel spreadsheet and identifies correlations by grouping data points in squares, that appear to have a relationship. My favorite data visualization in the reading was the lowess model. The lowess model uses regular data points but organizes them based on location, which is very useful.
